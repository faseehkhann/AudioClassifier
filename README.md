The following Project Classify whether the Capuchinbird audio is present in the audio clip or not and give you a count about the number
of time Capuchinbird audio is hered in a audio.It uses deep learning techniques to classify those capuchinbird audio.

You can download the dataset from this link: https://www.kaggle.com/kenjee/z-by-hp-unlocked-challenge-3-signal-processing

Hierarchy for the Completion of the AudioClassifier Project:

1. Loading Dataset

2. Converting Audio Files into Wave Form and Reshaping those Files

3. Preprocessing by converting those audio Waves to Spectogram

4. Building Deep Learning Model

5. Training Model on Training Dataset

6. Predicting the Unseen Audio Data
